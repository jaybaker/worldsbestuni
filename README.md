# The World's Best University

**Introduction**
------------------------------

We enjoy an embarrassment of riches when it comes to online 
teaching, tutorial resources, etc.

This is a living collection, bookmarks really, of resources that may 
be useful if you are interested in some of the same things that interest me.

Expect to see links to code repositories, papers and articles, 
YouTube videos, and books.
